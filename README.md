# Open Health Data Project
This project involves importing, cleaning up, storing, analyzing and visualizing data such as duration, distance and heart rate during activity, sleep time and quality or nutrients supplied from food. The application would work offline with the possibility of sharing selected data with others in order to compare them with each other.
